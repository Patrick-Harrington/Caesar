## Description
This project was inspired by a topic covered in a "Cryptography Concepts" class where letter frequency in the English language was used to crack the Caesar Cipher. I originally wrote frequency_analysis.c to demonstrate this, but decided shortly after that to expand the project. Currently this repository is a place to experiment with the Caesar Cipher and as always, gain more experience writing C.
